      <!-- Youn -->
      <div class="factionbox">
        <h3 class="factiontitle">Youn</h3>
        <p3 class="factiontext">Youn is a mighty empire, spanning the entire world, one of the worlds leading powers along the rivaling nation of Exalia.</p3>
        <p3 class="factiontext">The empire reaches far and wide, and it covers deserts, steppes, tundras and jungles. Youn is such a big empire that there </p3>

          Please don't ask me about lore on this. I intentionally kept it vauge so that i can at any point use it to fit whatever narrative is forming.

      <!-- Exalia -->
      <div class="factionbox">
        <h3 class="factiontitle">Exalia</h3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          Just like Youn, Exalia is also a world spanning empire, although it is slightly smaller, it has proven time and time again that it is not to be regarderd as Youn's inferior.
        </p3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          Exalias citizens are mainly elves, most of which are high elves. They recently declared war on Youn, to exploit an advantage granted to them by the mythical metal IX-25.
        </p3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          They are known to recruit women, and many divisions are partly or entierly female. This is done to reduce the overall barbarity of military action, which in turn allows military action to a bit more discrete. A trail of burned villages and
          destruction behind it everywhere is the last thing an empire needs, particularly if it's continued exsistance relies on some general idea of imagined superiority and civility.
        </p3>

        <p3 class="footnote"> This is low key France, a counterpart to the obvious British empire, although way more evil.</p3>

      <!-- Demons -->
      <div class="factionbox">
        <h3 class="factiontitle">Favans Demons</h3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          After expelling the mortal races from Valisia, wiping their memories and making it inhospitable, Favan sent an entire entourage of servants and soilders to protect and take care of lady Elia. They have on occasion come to blows with The
          first cohort and other valisisan natives that still remained in Valisisa
        </p3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          Due to pressure from the invaders from both Youn and Exalia, the Demons in Valisia are nothing but remnants of their former selves, and they have failed in their one mission, to protect lady Elia. It is unknown what will happen to them
          now, but it Favan is not known to revard failure.</p3>

      <!-- The First Cohort -->
      <div class="factionbox">
        <h3 class="factiontitle">The First Cohort</h3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          An anicent nation. It was destroyed by Demon king Favan when he rid valisia of mortals. However, the first cohort was a rough place that fostered resentment, anger, bitterness and rage. As such a considerable poriton of the spirits could
          not find peace, and now haunt various fortresses in the area they used to live.
        </p3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          These warriors seem to not fully understand that they are dead, nor do they seem to grasp how long time has gone by. Their conciousness too must have been affected by the spell Favan used to wipe the memories of the mortals of valisia.
          They seem to remember their animosity towards the demons though, and are open to cooperate with anyone in valisia willing to fight for the common goal of removing the demons from the land.
        </p3>

        <p3 class="factiontext">
          Led by the man that originally founded the nation, and their first mighty general-king, Cai Junnian. They might yet become a force to be reckoned with.
        </p3>

        <p3 class="footnote">
          I actually just took 1800s-1918 German empire/Prussia and mixed it together with the roman empire to make the most warlike faction i could concieve of.
