                            Favanistan is a might city built in an arid and desolate hellscape by the demon Favan. The city is innately linked with it's creator, when Favan suffers, so does Favanistan. King Favan delegates most of the day-to-day rulership of favanistan onto his five pentarhcs, occasonally reffered to as "Favan's Dukes". These pentarchs are selected by Favan and eachother amongst the finest and most upstanding citizens within their respecrive districts, they are then imbued with extraordinary abilities by the demon king, and are expected to carry out his will.

                            Favanistan is as anicent as the city's creator. In recent times it is the site of much political struggle and organized crime, different factions fight for control of the ever scarcer resources.

                            Valisia is the might and desolate continent at the end of the world. It is a place where nothing grows, and in all ways highly unsuitable for mortal men to live in, save for a few underground cavitites with volcanic activity that may or may not exsist. That wasn't always the case though. It used to be a bustling region until Favans reckoning, when Facan opened a portal to valisia and made it unlivable.

                            Nowadays rumours are spreading of rare metals with extraordinary properties, and that they might be found in vast quantities in Valisisa.
